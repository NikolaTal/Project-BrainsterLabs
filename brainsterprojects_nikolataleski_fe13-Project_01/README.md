## Technologies
- BOOTSTRAP 5.3 is the most used tool in this project.

## Installation
- To use this project download the files from the next link: https://git.brainster.co/Nikola.Taleski-FE13/brainsterprojects_nikolataleski_fe13/-/tree/Project_01 and open the home.html file. Than from the navbar you can see all other pages.

## Page one
### Header

- The purpose of the header is ultimately to organize us during the visit to our website. The main logo of the company (Brainster's logo) is located on the left site аnd its purpose is if it's clicked to take us back to the first (main) page.

- The navigation is located on the right side together with the button "Вработи наш студент". If one of the nav-item's is clicked, it takes us to a new page corresponding to it. And as for the "Вработи наш студент" button, its purpose is to take us to the next page (Contact form).

### Main banner

- The main banner is located just below the navbar and it's showing us what is the name of the project. The entire section should also be responsive on all three devices.

### Main section (Cards&Filters)

- One title and 20 cards are displayed in this section. Each card is connected with one of three buttons (located at the top of this section ) representing the three academies (Marketing Academy, Programming Academy and Design Academy).

- One of the tasks in this section is to show only the cards of the selected academy. After the button is unclicked all cards should be displayed again.

- Regarding the responsiveness of different devices, three cards should be displayed in a line on a laptop, two cards in a line on a tablet, and only one card in a line on a mobile screen. Additionally, оnly 6 cards should be displayed on mobile and below them should be located one "load more" button to show the other cards as well.

### Footer

- The footer is located at the bottom of the page and it shows who made the project.

## Page two

### Form

- The main purpose of why this second page exists is the form. Here the user has to insert all the required data.

- Our task was to do validation for all inputs and dropdown list.

- For the responsiveness, on a laptop two inputs are shown in one row, while on a tablet and a mobile phone is shown one input in one row.

## Gitlab

- Multiple commits have been made during the coding of this project for each branch separately. After several commits, the changes are pushed to GitLab using the "git push" command.
